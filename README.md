# Audio Player with HTML and CSS
This code provides an example of how to create an audio player using HTML and CSS. It uses the audio element in HTML5 to load an MP3 file and allows users to play, pause, and adjust the volume of the audio file.

# Demo
Here's a demo of the audio player in action:

# How to Use
To use the audio player, simply embed the code into an HTML file, replace the src attribute in the source element with the URL of your MP3 file, and adjust the name attribute to match the name of your audio file.

```html

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://example.com/audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
<div class="audio-player">
  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="progress"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="controls">
    <div class="play-container">
      <div class="toggle-play play">
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="time">
      <div class="current">0:00</div>
      <div class="divider">/</div>
      <div class="length"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="name">Audio File Name</div>
    <div class="volume-container">
      <div class="volume-button">
        <div class="volume icono-volumeMedium"></div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="volume-slider">
        <div class="volume-percentage"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
